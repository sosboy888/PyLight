# PyLight
A python project to record in-game highlights on your Windows PC!

## What is the project's purpose?
The script will automatically store the last 15-30 seconds of your gameplay in your disk the moment you press your desired button!

## How to change the buttons?
Check the PyLightSettings.py file and modify the variables there to modify the settings.

## What is left in this project?
Audio recording. For now the script only records video data. The FPS can be changed in the settings to adjust the video speed, it is highly advised that you do not change the resolution variables as that can break the recording procedure! :(
